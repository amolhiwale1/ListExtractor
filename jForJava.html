Last updated: 20/10/2024

1. Introduction

Welcome to the Java Learning Helper extension. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information when you use our Chrome extension. By using the extension, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

2. Information We Collect

This extension does not collect, store, or share any personal information such as your name, email address, or browsing activity.

3. How We Use Information

The Java Learning Helper extension is designed to provide educational content about Java programming concepts. It randomly selects and displays Java concepts based on the userâ€™s selection of Easy, Medium, or Hard categories. The extension also provides a reference link to Google for further learning.

We do not track, store, or share any user activity or preferences. No external APIs are used in this extension.

4. Permissions

Our extension requests minimal permissions required for its functionality:

storage: This permission allows the extension to store user preferences locally on your device, such as selected difficulty levels.
activeTab: This permission is necessary to allow the extension to interact with the active Chrome tab when the reference link is displayed.

We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of external API providers, and we encourage you to review their privacy policies.

5. Data Security

We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. Since our extension does not store any personal data, there is no sensitive information to protect. However, the external API requests are made securely, using encryption (HTTPS) to ensure the integrity of the data transmission.

6. User Rights

Since the extension does not collect personal data, you do not need to take any action to protect your privacy. However, if you believe there has been a breach of this policy, or if you have concerns about how the extension functions, you can contact us at [your email address].

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and we will update the "last updated" date at the top of the policy. We encourage you to review this privacy policy periodically for any updates.
